# Introducing SIBAJ

## Note: This is EXPERIMENTAL software

Assume that it will break your mouse and void your warranty. Although this hasn't happened to me (yet), I make no guarantees that it won't happen to you. Any use of anything in this repo is at your own risk.

### Motivation

I recently bought a razer naga v2 hyperspeed, which seems like a decent mouse so far, but a 500mb _mouse_ driver feels like total insanity. Particularly when I only really need it for assigning functions to the side buttons.

So I figured, why not just reverse engineer the USB messaging and supplement the built-in windows driver that already does everything else just fine?

Refusing to install that monstrosity on my bare metal system, I installed it in a VM just for one-time key bindings, and realized that synapse is bloated adware junk.
